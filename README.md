e is a zero-dependency micro library for dealing with errors on JVM. It aims to unify error handling across different JVM applications by providing an error model, ways to encode/decode errors and ways to use errors throughout your codebase.

It consists of different modules for different needs. You can find details, instructions and documentation about each of them on their own pages.
